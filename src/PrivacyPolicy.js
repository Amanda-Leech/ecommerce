      <p>Privacy Policy</p>
      Welcome to the official web site of Girl Scouts of Utah. This web site is
      owned and operated by Girl Scouts of Utah, a 501(c)(3) non-profit
      organization headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and chartered by Girl
      Scouts of the USA, headquartered in New York, NY. Girl Scouts of Utah is
      committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors. This privacy policy
      discloses how we collect, protect, and use information you provide us
      online, as well as how we protect children's privacy. By using the pages
      on this site, you are accepting the practices described in the Privacy
      Policy. If our policy practices change in the future, we will let you know
      by posting the policy changes on our web site. However, we will treat all
      personal information we collect in accordance with the privacy notice in
      effect at the time the information is collected. Girl Scouts' online
      properties comprise of, but are not limited to, all pages found under
      www.gsutah.org, including our official online store.
      <p>Data Collection</p>
      Girl Scouts of Utah uses its best efforts to respect and protect the
      privacy of its online visitors. At our site, we do not collect personally
      identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us
      voluntarily and knowingly. This means we do not require you to register or
      provide information to us in order to view our site. Girl Scouts of Utah
      only gathers personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses,
      zip/postal codes, e-mail addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by a
      visitor. For example, personally identifiable information is collected in
      order to process online transactions, online donations, or job
      applications. This information is used solely by Girl Scouts of Utah, Girl
      Scouts of the USA, or other entities who are involved in the operation of
      this site for internal purposes. We do not sell information you provide to
      us online to third parties. We will only share personally identifiable
      information with third parties when (i) the person submitting the
      information authorizes us to share it; (ii) sharing the information is a
      necessary operation of the site, for instance, to process a credit card
      transaction, or (iii) we are required to by law. Girl Scouts of Utah has
      no control over or responsibility for the data collection and use
      practices of third parties that process online transactions.
      <p>Children's Privacy</p>
      The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) protects the personal
      information of children under the age of 13. This applies to individually
      identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as
      full name, home address, e-mail address, telephone number or any other
      information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The
      Act and Rule also cover other types of information—for example, hobbies,
      interests and information collected through cookies or other types of
      tracking mechanisms—when they are tied to individually identifiable
      information. It is important for you to understand this law; we encourage
      you to read more about COPPA.
      <p>Note to Parents on Our Privacy</p>
      Policy: Girl Scouts of Utah is committed to providing a safe, secure, and
      fun online experience for children who visit our site. We are dedicated to
      safeguarding any personal information collected online and to helping
      parents and children have positive experiences on the Internet. Consistent
      with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never
      knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under
      the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. Parents can
      revoke their consent and ask that information about their children be
      deleted from the site by contacting our offices by phone at (801)
      265-8472. To do this or to review personal information collected from
      children, we must verify the identity of the requesting parent. When a
      parent revokes consent, we will stop collecting, using, or disclosing
      information from that child. To respect the privacy of parents,
      information collected and used for the sole purpose of obtaining
      verifiable parental consent or providing notice is not maintained in
      retrievable form by the site if parental consent is not obtained after a
      reasonable time. Girl Scouts believes it is good policy not to collect
      more personally identifiable information from children under 13 than is
      necessary for them to participate in our online activities. In addition,
      be aware that all sites that are targeted to children under 13 are
      prohibited by law from collecting more information than they need.
      <p>Submissions</p>
      Girl Scouts of Utah welcomes children to learn more about our organization
      and, where appropriate, participate in polls and surveys, as well as
      submit comments, artwork, writings, and other submissions for posting on
      our web site. For this reason, Girl Scouts of Utah follows the guidelines
      for interactive electronic media published by the Children's Advertising
      Review Unit (CARU) of the Better Business Bureau for pages targeted to
      children under 13. However, we encourage this be done only with their
      parent's knowledge and supervision. We also encourage children to use an
      alias (e.g., "Bookworm", "Skater", etc.), first name, nickname, initials,
      or other alternative to full names or screen names which correspond with
      an e-mail address for any activities which will involve public posting. In
      keeping with CARU's Principle regarding respecting and fostering the
      parents' role in providing guidance for their children, we encourage
      parents to check and monitor their children's use of e-mail and other
      online activities regularly.
      <p>Use of Cookies</p>
      Visitors should be aware that non-personal information and data may be
      automatically collected by the Girl Scouts of Utah web site through the
      use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a Web site can use to
      recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor's ongoing access to and
      use of the site, and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile
      aggregate data that will allow content improvements. Cookies are not
      programs that come onto a visitor's system and damage files. Generally,
      cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor that has no
      meaning outside the assigning site. If a visitor does not want information
      collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most
      browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature.
      Girl Scouts of Utah uses "cookie" technology only to obtain non-personal
      information from its online visitors in order to improve visitors' online
      experience and facilitate their visit within our site. We use third-party
      advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These
      companies may use non-personally identifiable information (that is, not
      including your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about
      your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements
      about goods and services of interest to you on this or other websites.
      Read more information about this practice and to know your choices about
      not having this information used by these companies.
      <p> Links to Other Websites and Services</p>
      This site may be linked to other sites and services that are not
      maintained by Girl Scouts of Utah. These web sites have their own privacy
      policies, which you should review prior to visiting them. We have no
      responsibility for linked web sites and provide these links solely for the
      convenience and information of our visitors.
      <p>Our Security Safeguard</p>
      The safety and security of your online experience is of the utmost concern
      to us. We ensure the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
      procedures are in place to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access,
      maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect
      online.
      <p>Credit Card Safety</p>
      Protecting the safety of your credit card information is also important to
      us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security
      of your credit card information as it is transmitted to us. SSL is the
      industry standard in Internet encryption technology, which is a highly
      sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer
      to our web site servers. We also encrypt your credit card number when we
      store your order and whenever we transfer that information to
      participating merchants. To make sure you are accessing our secure server
      before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower
      left-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed
      lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check
      for security, look at the URL or Address line of your browser. If you have
      accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line
      should change from "http" to "https." It is important for you to protect
      against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure
      to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
      <p>Children</p>
      If you are under 18, you need parent/guardian permission to use a credit
      card to make purchases online.
